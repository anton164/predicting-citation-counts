The infection of protoplasts with a tomato strain of tobacco mosaic virus occurred most efficiently when the inoculum contained 1 \u00b5g/ml virus, 1 \u00b5g/ml poly-l-ornithine and 0.01 m-phosphate buffer, pH 6.7. The efficiency of infection was influenced by the concentration of ions as well as by the pH of inoculation buffer. The virus infected protoplasts of plants homozygous for the gene Tm-2a, which is responsible for TMV-resistance of intact leaves, and multiplied as rapidly in them as in protoplasts from the susceptible parent line. In TMV-inoculated leaf discs prepared from the resistant plants, however, the growth of virus was very limited when compared with the large yield of virus obtained from leaf discs of the susceptible plants. The possible nature of the resistance is discussed in the light of these findings."}

Two pulsed Nd-YAG lasers are used in tandem, one (532 nm) for target vapourization and the other (355 nm) for cluster ionization. Methanol clusters of nuclearity up to 14 (mass 500 amu) were produced from liquid methanol as the test sample. The clusters were detected with a mass resolution of \u223c 2500 in the R-TOF geometry. Carbon clusters up to a nuclearity of 28 were obtained using a polyimide target.

This is unfortunate because radio is bound up with women's lives more than most other media. Women are under-represented as contributors in most areas of radio Afternoon radio plays, phone-in and medical programmes, and magazine programmes-all tend to present images of nuclear families with fulfilled women at their centre. In the past few years, some alternatives have been initiated, from Rome's feminist Radio Donna, to America's WOMN-1220, a commercial women's radio station. In Britain, there has been a successful local radio series raising issues important to housebound women with children. And the Women's Radio Workshop has just started making feminist radio programmes which it hopes will be broadcast on local radio."}

Two main variables, namely demography and metallurgical production, are examined in the light of both conventional and spatial statistical methods (with particular emphasis on significance testing) with the aim of assessing the wider issue of social complexity. Among the various conclusions emerging from this empirical study, two stand out. Firstly, neither the correlation between the total extension of the settlement and the complexity of its internal organisation, nor the spatial delimitation between domestic/productive and funerary practices is as straightforward as previously claimed. Secondly, no simple, clear-cut statistical patterns are found in the spatial distribution of human remains or metal objects. These conclusions provide the basis for a critique of currently held interpretations of Valencina de la Concepcion as the political centre of an early state extending across the lower Guadalquivir valley."}

The aim of the present study was to compare and analyze the differences between these gliomas in juvenile and adult rats with regard to tumor growth, survival, pathology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A total of 25 juvenile and 25 adult Wistar rats were divided into groups A (15 juvenile rats), B (10 juvenile rats), C (15 adult rats) and D (10 adult rats). The rats of groups A and C (experimental) were injected with glioma cells, while groups B and D (control) were injected with a physiological saline solution. Rat neurological signs, survival time, tumor size, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical staining for MMP-2, MMP-9 and \u03b2-catenin were compared. The survival time of group A was 19.47\u00b12.232 days, whereas that of group C was 21.47\u00b12.232 days (P 0.05) in groups A and C, respectively.

This technique allows separate determinations of the optical mean thickness, the average refractive index and the adsorbed amount of an adsorbed polymer film. The low optical contrast of the water-EHEC-polystyrene system makes measurements of these quantities difficult, but we show that they can be determined with sufficient accuracy by using a modern high precision ellipsometer.  At room temperature, EHEC adsorbs sparsely on polystyrene surfaces (\u0393=lmg/m 2 ), forming layers with an optical mean thickness that slightly exceeds 30 nm. Raising the temperature results in increasing adsorption and a simultaneous contraction of the adsorbed layer. The conjunction of these opposing trends leads to a strong decrease of the ellipsometric thickness near the bulk phase separation temperature at this surface. The adsorbed layer contains a fraction highly extended but dilute tails, reflected by its large hydrodynamic extension, as observed by photon correlation spectroscopy measurements (\u03b4 h \u03b4110 nm at 20\u00b0C). This fraction, however, does not significantly affect the interaction forces between two EHEC coated surfaces."}

We consider three different adaptive transmission schemes: (i) variable-power, variable-rate adaptive transmission, (ii) complete channel inversion with fixed rate, and (iii) truncated channel inversion with fixed rate. For the considered systems, highly accurate series expressions for ergodic capacity are derived using a series expansion of the modified Bessel function and the Mellin transformation of the Gamma-Gamma random variable. Our asymptotic analysis reveals that the high SNR ergodic capacities of coherent, subcarrier intensity modulated, and polarization multiplexing systems gain 0.33 bits/s/Hz, 0.66 bits/s/Hz, and 0.66 bits/s/Hz respectively with 1 dB increase of average transmitted optical power. Numerical results indicate that a polarization control error less than 10\u00b0 has little influence on the capacity performance of polarization multiplexing systems."}

The bulk of the paper argues in favor of an inversion analysis of specificational pseudoclefts in Malagasy: a predicate DP is fronted to a topic position from within a small clause constituent. Moreover, it is shown that the same inversion occurs in equative and specificational sentences in Malagasy, which suggests that these types of sentences share the same syntactic structure.

The phylum is divided into two classes, Cyclorhagida and Allomalorhagida, congruent with the two major clades recovered in recent phylogenetic analyses. Allomalorhagida accommodates more than one-third of the described species, most of them assigned to the family Pycnophyidae. All previous phylogenetic analyses of the phylum recovered the two genera within Pycnophyidae, Pycnophyes and Kinorhynchus, as paraphyletic and polyphyletic. A major problem in these studies was the lack of molecular data of most pycnophyids, due to the limited and highly localized distribution of most species, often in the Arctic and the deep-sea. We here overcame the problem by adding a morphological partition with data for 79 Pycnophyidae species, 15 of them also represented by molecular data. Model-based analyses yielded seven clades, which each was supported by several morphological apomorphies. Accordingly, Kinorhynchus is synonymized with Pycnophyes and six new genera are described for the remaining recovered clades: Leiocanthus gen. nov., Cristaphyes gen. nov., Higginsium gen. nov., Krakenella gen. nov., Setaphyes gen. nov. and Fujuriphyes gen. nov."}

There is a 10-year shift in the cardiovascular risk between women and men. The risk in a 55-year-old female patient is similar to that of a 45-year-old man, thus the risk among women increases rapidly around the age of 50, when menopause prevails to occur. The purpose of the study was to assess and compare the SCORE-predicted risk of a fatal cardiovascular incident in pre- and postmenopausal women.The cross-sectional study was conducted as part of community nursing practice. It covered 219 women - inhabitants of Krakow, aged from 30 to 65, without clinically validated cardiovascular diseases of arteriosclerotic and/or diabetic origin, who volunteered to take part in the study. The group was divided into three subgroups: K1 - menstruating women (n = 113), K2a - women after natural menopause (n = 88), and K2b - women after surgical menopause (n = 18). The study made use of a lifestyle questionnaire, which concerned the social and economic status, and lifestyle habits including tobacco smoking. Arterial blood pressure was measured, and total cholesterol concentration in blood (mmol/l) was recorded.A high (\u2265 5%) level of the SCORE risk was discovered in 14.3% of postmenopausal women, as compared to 0.9% in the group of menstruating women. An average risk of a fatal cardiovascular incident during the following 10 years was significantly higher among women from groups K2a (2.61%) and K2b (2.32%) as compared to K1 - menstruating women (0.38%). No difference was, however, discovered between groups of naturally (K2a) and surgically menopausal women (K2b).A significantly higher risk of SCORE-predicted death caused by a cardiovascular incident, as compared to the group of women in the premenopausal period, is characteristic of women in the postmenopausal period."}

Protein ROA spectra provide information on the secondary and tertiary structure of the polypeptide backbone and effects of the local environment, including hydration and the side chain conformations of particular residues. The large number of structure-sensitive bands in protein ROA spectra is especially favourable for fold determination using pattern recognition techniques. Intact viruses may also be studied and their ROA spectra provide information not only on the folds of the coat proteins but also about the conformation of the encapsidated nucleic acid. In this article we present the ROA spectra of several proteins and viruses in order to illustrate some of the applications of ROA spectroscopy in biomolecular research."}

The second approach adds mapping information to the data after the user plane processing is almost finalized. Each forward-error encoded transport block, its modulation and coding scheme and the resources where it will be transmitted are multicast over the interconnect network.

For linear SISO systems of known order without right half plane zeros and arbitrary variation of transfer function coefficients within a given bounded set, a modeling error compensator can be designed which guarantees robust stability and an arbitrary small H/sub /spl infin//-norm of the tracking error transfer function over a given frequency band.

Methods: Twenty-three males and 34 females with a mean age of 9.3 \u00b1 2.5 years were recruited from a local primary and secondary school. Questionnaires were used to sort participants into four independent groups active/breakfast eaters, nonactive/breakfast eaters, active/breakfast skippers and non-active/breakfast skippers. Measures of height, weight, BMI and body fat percentage were taken and used to identify subjects who were overweight/over-fat or obese. The data was analysed using SPSS 17.0 to compare the prevalence of overweight and obesity and BMI body fat percentage between groups. Results: One-hundred percent of participants reported eating breakfast on most school days, leaving only two independent groups according to transport status. Primary school children who used non-active methods of transport to school were significantly heavier (30.5 \u00b1 6.49 kg) than those who actively commuted to school (26.3 \u00b1 5.37 kg; p = 0.002). The prevalence of overweight (p = 0.022) and over-fat (p = 0.003) were significantly greater among year 4 children who used non-active transport methods to school (15.4%), compared to those who actively commuted to school (0%). Mean BMI (p = 0.004) and body fat percentage (p = 0.008) were significantly greater among year 4 children who used non-active transport methods to school (17.0 \u00b1 1.37 kg/m2 and 20.6 \u00b1 3.48 %), compared to those who used active transport methods to school (14.6 \u00b1 0.70 kg/m2 and 14.7 \u00b1 3.11). Conclusions: Active transport to school is appears to be protective against overweight and obesity among children in year 4. The effects of active transport to school on BMI and body fat percentage among the whole sample and among other sample subsets are unclear and further research is required to clarify these relationships."}

This progressive mismatch suggests a deterioration of muscle \u201cquality\u201d that may lead to functional incapacities. Although it may be difficult to synthesize the concept of muscle quality, the aim of the present paper was to propose a clinical definition of muscle quality in regard to the functional status. Accordingly, the muscle strength or muscle power per unit of muscle mass ratios appear to be clinically relevant markers of muscle quality. Several mechanisms susceptible to influence these ratios have been described, among which age, gender, sex hormones, obesity, physical activity and fibrosis. Various methods to assess muscle quality in both the clinical and research fields have also been listed, with a particular interest for the tests used to measure muscle power. Finally, we proposed a clinical screening tool to detect individuals at risk of functional incapacities. Briefly, the muscle quality score is based on handgrip strength assessment by hand dynamometer, muscle mass measurement by bioelectrical analysis, and leg muscle power estimation using a chair stand test."}

Helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors show great potential for pulmonary gene therapy, but the knowledge of pulmonary immune responses toward these vectors is very limited. In this study, we show that HD-Ad vectors are potent stimulators of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, thus leading to stimulation of T cell proliferation with \u223c6% of naive CD4 +  T cells from pulmonary mediastinal lymph node responding to HD-Ad-treated DCs. In contrast to the belief that HD-Ad vectors are unable to prime adaptive immune response, we show for the first time, through in vivo pulmonary studies in mice, that HD-Ad vectors can prime CD4 +  and CD8 +  T cell responses in the lung at high and substantially low doses. This indicates cross-presentation of HD-Ad-derived epitopes by DCs to prime CD8 +  T cell responses. To assess the basis of pulmonary T cell response against HD-Ad vectors, we examined the response of conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) in the lung. In response to HD-Ad delivery, there is induction of maturation in both cDC and pDC subsets, but it is the cDCs, not pDCs, that migrate rapidly to draining lymph nodes within the first 2 days after vector delivery to prime adaptive immune response against these vectors. These findings have implications for development of strategies to prevent adaptive immune responses against gene therapy vectors."}

The greater the number of overlaps between the units belonging to corresponding slices, the greater the concordance between the d distributions.

Despite this, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies in the BPM domain that investigate how to gain or increase executive commitment. This issue is addressed with experienced, international BPM practitioners using an on-line, openquestion survey. Responses from over 40 international companies identified over 100 data items pertaining to strategies useful in increasing executive commitment to BPM. In this paper, these responses are classified into eight categories of strategy, supplemented with experiences gained in conducting detailed case studies with organizations practicing BPM and considered on the basis of potential relationships between the respondents, demographic data and the derived categories."}

In contrast, physiological neurons are typically either excitatory or inhibitory, not both. This is a puzzle, because it seems to constrain computation, and because there are several counter-examples that suggest that it may not be a physiological necessity. Parisien et?al. (2008) showed that any mixture of excitatory and inhibitory functional connections could be realized by a purely excitatory projection in parallel with a two-synapse projection through an inhibitory population. They showed that this works well with ratios of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that are realistic for the neocortex, suggesting that perhaps the cortex efficiently works around this apparent computational constraint. Extending this work, we show here that mixed excitatory and inhibitory functional connections can also be realized in networks that are dominated by inhibition, such as those of the basal ganglia. Further, we show that the function-approximation capacity of such connections is comparable to that of idealized mixed-weight connections. We also study whether such connections are viable in recurrent networks, and find that such recurrent networks can flexibly exhibit a wide range of dynamics. These results offer a new perspective on computation in the basal ganglia, and also perhaps on inhibitory networks within the cortex."}

This is a difficult task if one focuses solely on the intrinsic properties of the fetus, as many philosophical and biological accounts of personhood tend to do. Further, it is a task complicated by the integration of medical technologies into the embodied experience of pregnancy and popular discourses about fetal personhood. I argue that a conception of personhood that pays due regard to the intrinsic and relational aspects of fetal being has greater potential both to explain the existing criminal law, and to guide future developments, than does a theory based solely on the intrinsic properties of the fetus. The theory developed here is consistent with retaining the 'born alive' rule. However, in the event that the courts decide to abandon the rule for the purposes of homicide, the theory also provides a basis for confining the recognition of fetal personality to the context of feticide caused by third party assaults on pregnant women."}

In this study, the metallography of these machining chips was examined using both optical and scanning electron microscopy with the goal of better understanding the cutting mechanism and the origin of the load fluctuations. It was determined that the load variations were associated with periodic variations in chip thickness, implying a periodic variation in shear angle. It is difficult to detect such a variation in shear angle using an etch to identify deformation patterns, but shear angle variations could be inferred from the chip morphology and from the distortion of the lead particles in the machining chip. A simple model is presented which exhibits periodic shear angle variations if deformation is assumed to occur in a shear zone of finite thickness and if the material\u2019s workhardening capacity is exhausted at strains comparable with those developed during machining. Computations incorporating the features of this model are shown to accurately reproduce the pattern of the experimental observations."}

Understanding the mechanisms by which the protein recognizes specific DNA sequences is one of the main topics in biology. With increased amount of crystal structures, conformational changes of proteins in DNA interfaces are suggested to be one of important factors in DNA recognition. To better understand a role of the deformation of the proteins, we carried out quantitative analyses of local conformational changes observed in DNA interfaces.We first extracted crystal structures of DNA-unbound and DNA-bound states from PDB. We then described the backbone structures with the 7-letters-codes which were pre-defined for expressing conformations of 4 consecutive fragments. Using the letter codes, we identified conformational changes between DNA-unbound and bound states.Then, we compared the amino acid composition and secondary structures of these conformationally variable regions in DNA interfaces with that in molecular surfaces. We found the regions in DNA interfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, less acidic residues, and have less secondary structure elements. We also found that conformations of the regions that bind to DNA in the minor groove are frequently changed and the width of the minor grooves is wider than that of the canonical B-DNA."}

Treatment with dopamine agonist (DA) has been shown to reduce body weight and improve metabolic parameters. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of obesity, overweight, MS, and IR in patients with prolactinoma before and after therapy with DA and to evaluate the relation between prolactin (PRL), body weight, fat distribution, leptin levels, IR, and lipid profile before treatment. In addition, we investigated the correlation of the reduction in PRL levels with weight loss and metabolic profile improvement. Twenty-two patients with prolactinoma completed 6 months of treatment with DA. These patients were submitted to clinical (BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure (BP)), laboratory evaluation (leptin, glucose, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) levels) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) before and after treatment. The statistical analyses were done by nonparametric tests. At the beginning of the study, the prevalence of obesity, overweight, MS, and IR was 45, 27, 27, and 18%, respectively. After 6 months of treatment with DA, PRL levels normalized, but no significant difference in BMI was observed. However, there was a significant decrease on homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR) index, glucose, LDL-cholesterol, and TG levels. This study suggests a possible involvement of prolactinoma on the prevalence of obesity. We should consider that DA may be effective on improving metabolic parameters, and we speculate that a period longer than 6 months of treatment is necessary to conclude whether this drug can interfere in the body weight of patients with prolactinoma."}
